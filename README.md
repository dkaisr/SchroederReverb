# SchroederReverb
A lightweight cross-platform VST3 reverb plugin written in C++ with the JUCE framework

## Why I built this
I didnâ€™t have much experience with digital audio before starting this project,
but as soon as I began exploring the field,
I wanted to dive deeper -- not just to understand how things work, but to also create something I might actually use.


This became my first real project in C++ and my first time working with the JUCE framework.

Reverb seemed like a good starting point: simple enough to implement,
but still complex enough to learn something meaningful along the way.

By building this plugin, I learned the fundamentals of creating my own DSP effects,
using CMake and designing simple user interfaces.

I'm quite happy with how it's turned out so far.
